## There are three steps in the entire web development process: 

1. Create Repositories on Github, then use VS-Code to clone to the local hard disk, and then establish the basic solution structure of the website files;
2. Use Bootstrap to create specific content and realize the layout design of the webpage according to the webpage layout and project requirements designed by yourself;
3. For detailed modification and personalized adjustment in CSS file, check the project requirements one by one to confirm compliance with the standards, and finally create a web page on GitHub and submit it.

 **The development of this project is not very difficult, but it requires a lot of patience to apply what you usually learn in class to the code.**
